# DREAM - Data-dRiven prEdictive fArMing - Software Engineering 2 Project - A.Y. 2021-2022
DREAM - Data-dRiven prEdictive fArMing is a Requirement Engineering and Design Project realized for the Software Engineering 2 course at Politecnico di Milano.
Requirement analysis and design choices are widely described inside the released documents:
- __Requirements Analysis and Specifications Document__ ([RASD v1.2.pdf](DeliveryFolder/RASD1.2.pdf));
- __Design Document__ (DD1.0.pdf);

Artifacts of the project can be found in the [DeliveryFolder](DeliveryFolder).

## Structure of the repository
This repository contains all the files that were created in order to design, develop and test the project.
Below are listed alphabetically all the folders with their own content:
- `Assignments`: contains the specification of the project to be designed and implemented;
- `DD`: contains the TeX files used to build the Design Document;
- `DeliveryFolder`: contains the delivered documents RASD, DD;
- `RASD`: contains the TeX files used to build the Requirements Analysis and Specifications Document.

## The problem: DREAM - Data-dRiven prEdictive fArMing
Agriculture plays a pivotal role in India’s economy as over 58% of rural households depend on it as the
principal means of livelihood, 80% of whom are smallholder farmers with less than 5 acres of farmland.
More than a fifth of the smallholder farm households are below poverty.
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly highlighted the massive disruption caused in food supply chains
exposing the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, small holder farmers and the importance of
building resilient food systems. It has become even more important now that we develop and adopt innovative
methodologies and technologies that can help bolster countries against food supply shocks and
challenges.
The purpose of Data-dRiven prEdictive fArMing (DREAM) is to help Telangana’s government in designing,
developing, and demonstrating anticipatory models for food systems using digital public goods
and the community of agricultural worker. To achieve this DREAM allows the communication between
the users, gives the possibility to retrieve data from the sensors in Telangana, to track the evolutions of
the work of farmers, and to access the data from farmers or from any other sources.

### Goal of the project
The ambition of this project is that the adoption of DREAM will help the sustainability of the agricultural
workers in Telangana. This is crucial during a pandemic emergency, like the one that is going on, because
the farmers are the ones more afflicted.
